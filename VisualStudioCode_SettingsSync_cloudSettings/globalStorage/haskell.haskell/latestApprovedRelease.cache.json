Language Server 1.1.0 has finally come! Many thanks to all contributors -- since the last release, we have merged over 100 PRs!\r\nAs always, there are many internal bug fixes and performance improvements in ghcide. Apart from that,\r\n\r\n* Wingman gets many enhancements, thanks to @isovector for this epic work!\r\n  * Wingman actions can now be bound to editor hotkeys\r\n  * Experimental support for \"jump to next unsolved hole\"\r\n  * Improved layout algorithm --- don't reflow instances, or break do-blocks\r\n  * Wingman can now deal with GADTs, rank-n types and pattern synonyms\r\n  * Wingman now respects user-written bindings on the left side of the equals sign\r\n  * Significantly more-natural synthesized code when dealing with newtypes, infix operators, records and strings\r\n  * Improved user experience --- less waiting, and friendly errors for when things go wrong\r\n* hlint plugin not working in some cases gets fixed\r\n* annoying log message \"haskell-lsp:incoming message parse error\" gets fixed in `lsp-1.2`\r\n* eval plugin now supports `it` variable, like GHCi\r\n* verbose message \"No cradle found for ... Proceeding with implicit cradle\" is GONE\r\n* type lenses plugin now has its custom config `mode` (enum) [`always`] to control its working mode:\r\n  * `always`: always displays type signature lenses of global bindings\r\n  * `exported`: similar to `always`, but only displays for exported global bindings\r\n  * `diagnostics`: follows diagnostic messages produced by GHC\r\n* top-level LSP option `completionSnippetsOn` and `maxNumberOfProblems` are deprecated\r\n* completions plugin now has its custom config:\r\n  * `autoExtendOn` (boolean) [`true`]: whether to enable auto extending import lists\r\n  * `snippetsOn` (boolean) [`true`]: wheter to enable completion snippets, taking the place of `completionSnippetsOn`\r\n* Wingman has its custom config:\r\n  * `timeout_duration` (integer) [`2`]: the timeout for Wingman actions, in seconds\r\n  * `features` (string) [`\"\"`]: feature set used by Wingman (See [the README of Wingman](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/tree/master/plugins/hls-tactics-plugin#readme))\r\n  * `max_use_ctor_actions` (integer) [`5`]: maximum number of `Use constructor <x>` code actions that can appear\r\n  * `hole_severity` (enum) [`none`]: the severity to use when showing hole diagnostics\r\n* LSP symbols of typeclass and type families are more appropriate\r\n* test suite of plugins are reorganized, which no longer need to be run with `test-server` executable\r\n* two new packages `hls-test-utils` and `hls-stylish-haskell-plugin` are extracted\r\n\r\nThis version uses `lsp-1.2.0`, `hls-plugin-api-1.1.0`, and `ghcide-1.2.0.2`.\r\n\r\n### Pull requests merged for 1.1.0\r\n\r\n- Restore compat. with haddock-library
